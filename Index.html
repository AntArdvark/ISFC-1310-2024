            <div>  <p>UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College.</p>
              <p>Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers various sports including Baseball, Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and Women's Golf, Women's Volleyball, Women's Soccer, Women's Swimming/Diving, Men's and Women's Cross Country, Men's and Women's Track and Field (Indoor and Outdoor), and Men's wrestling. Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors. Wrestling is the school's newest sport, starting in 2019, and is the first Division I program in Arkansas. Little Rock will move to the Ohio Valley Conference for the 2022-23 season.</p>
